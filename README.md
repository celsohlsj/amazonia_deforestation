# Benchmark maps of deforestation for Amazonia

This dataset represents the mapping of deforestation (old-growth forest only) for Amazonia between 1986 and 2020 based on MapBiomas (https://amazonia.mapbiomas.org/en) land-use and land-cover maps. Below is some important information.
- Here we define deforestation as the replacement of a forest formation pixel with an anthropic pixel (e.g., farming, agriculture, urban, or mining) each year;
- We consider only the forest formation class (ID=3) from the MapBiomas dataset;
- We adopted 1985 as the baseline for the initial area of the old-growth forest;
- Once cleared, a forest pixel remains cleared; for mapping the dynamics of secondary forests, access: https://github.com/celsohlsj/gee_brazil_sv;
- The dataset is free to use, but if you use it in your work, please cite the zenodo repository and our paper correctly. We also welcome users to invite us for collaboration.
